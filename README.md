Hey, I'm a 20 years old student. From September I will begin my studies in computer engineering in apprenticeship in Lyon.

Since my childhood I learn and test a maximum of techniques and technologies around computer science it's a real passion but not the only one I got. I am also passionate about space, astronomy and astrophysics are subjects that fascinate me.

Moreover I had the chance to live half of my childhood abroad, this is why I love traveling so much and that I have this taste for adventure.
